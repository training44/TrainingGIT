New Delhi: BJP Chief Amit Shah justified poor allocation of central funds to the southern states. He did this while speaking in context of the upcoming Karnataka elections. 

Amit Shah counter questioned as to how Centre could run other aspects including country's army and embassies in foreign countries if more funds are given to states. 

The BJP President said that it is problem with just the states of the south. Speaking about upcoming elections he said that Lingayat issue would not yield anything to Congress in the Karnataka elections and called it a conspiracy of Congress on Yeddyurappa. Amit Shah exuded confidence that BJP will win the elections and that the combination of Modi and Yeddyurappa will take Karnataka forward!
